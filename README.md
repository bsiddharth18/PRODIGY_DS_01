# PRODIGY_DS_01 — Data Visualization Task
## Task Overview

This task focuses on visualizing the distribution of a categorical and a continuous variable using a real-world population dataset. The objective is to understand how data distributions can be represented visually to support basic analytical insights.

## Dataset

The dataset contains country-level population data across multiple years. For this task, a specific year was selected to compare population values across countries.

## Objective

1. Visualize population distribution using appropriate chart types

2. Differentiate between categorical and continuous variables

3. Present insights in a clear and interpretable format

## Tools & Technologies

- Python

- Pandas

- Matplotlib

- Visualizations Created

## Key Learnings

* Handling wide-format datasets and selecting relevant features

* Choosing the correct visualization based on variable type

* Improving chart readability by filtering and sorting data

* Understanding the importance of removing aggregate or non-country records for accurate analysis

## Conclusion

This task demonstrates how basic data cleaning and visualization techniques can be used to transform raw data into meaningful insights and support data-driven understanding.
